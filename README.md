# omnetpy

[OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) meets python

![pytictoc and its code](./pytictoc.png)

## What does this repository provide?

**TL;DR**: implement OMNeT++ simulations using python programming language:

- no need to know C++
- all the power of python is sudenly available
- faster prototypes
- even using the OMNeT++ IDE (if you wish...)

**Ok, I'm in... tell me more...**: TBD

## How can I use it?

Launch a contianer:

```
you@yourmachine$ docker run --rm -ti -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix mmodenesi/omnetpy bash
```

On the container, launch the omnetpp IDE:

```
userpp@container$ omnetpp
```

Follow the guides on how to create simulations with python (TBD)
